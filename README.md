# RISC-V Translator
This repo is a test project for implementing a RISC-V ISA translator, which will be used in main project [Riscambler-Multiplatform](https://github.com/alchal17/Riscambler-Multiplatform) - an IDE for RISC-V programming.

This version is an attempt to improve a translator made in [Riscambler Desktop](https://github.com/alchal17/Riscambler-Desktop) and will be removed soon after it's finished.
